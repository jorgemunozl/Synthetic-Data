A magical library hidden in an ancient forest, where books float in mid-air and glowing runes are etched into the wooden shelves. A wise old owl perches on a branch, observing a young wizard who is studying a levitating tome. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.
