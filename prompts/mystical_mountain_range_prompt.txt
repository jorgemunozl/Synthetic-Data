A mystical mountain range at dawn, with peaks shrouded in mist and clouds. The mountains are dotted with ancient temples and statues carved into the rock. In the sky, a flock of phoenixes soars gracefully, their fiery tails leaving trails of light. A hidden waterfall cascades down into a serene lake, surrounded by lush greenery.
