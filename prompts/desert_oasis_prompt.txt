A serene desert oasis at sunset, with palm trees surrounding a crystal-clear pool of water. Camels rest nearby, and a Bedouin tent is set up with colorful rugs and cushions. The sky is painted with hues of orange and pink, and a gentle breeze creates ripples on the water's surface, adding a sense of tranquility.
